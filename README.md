# AI Programming Project - Rule-Based Chatbot

**Name:** Benedict Sau  
**Registration Number:** 250594DAI 
**Project Title:** AI Chatbot - Rule-Based  
**Short Description:**  
A simple Python chatbot that answers frequently asked questions about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and university-related queries. The chatbot uses rule-based logic (if-else and keyword matching) to respond to user inputs. It handles at least 5 different user intents, providing polite and informative responses.  

## Project Overview
The **Course Assistant Bot** is a simple rule-based AI chatbot designed to help students with common questions about their courses. It uses **keyword matching** and **if–else logic** to provide informative and polite responses about course schedules, assignments, professors, AI topics, and recommended resources.

This bot is built in **Python** and demonstrates how a basic chatbot can be implemented without advanced AI or machine learning.
